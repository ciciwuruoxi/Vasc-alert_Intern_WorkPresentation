Database Integration – 10% of time 
Contributed to building the company’s first datalake by consolidating 28 databases spanning six years into a unified AWS environment. Collaborated with two engineers to design schema mappings, create a composite patient key, and optimize tables for query performance. This reduced data retrieval time from hours to minutes and established a single reliable source of truth for analytics.

Dashboard Creation – 50% of time 
Led the replacement of a 2005-era dashboard by first rebuilding the weekly ETL pipeline to standardize and refresh data automatically. Designed and implemented a new dashboard with standardized modules for score tracking, intervention history, and treatment outcomes, while improving usability with clear, interactive visuals. The result was faster reporting and real-time clinical insight.

Optimization – 40% of time

3.1 Automated Reader – Developed an automation pipeline replicating the “reader” function, using a rules-plus-ML hybrid model to parse structured/unstructured notes and match them against system records. This reduced manual review of “system-excluded data” from ~40 hours/week by over 80%.

3.2 NLP Model Training – Trained an NLP model to classify doctor notes into surgery types, achieving high accuracy on a labeled dataset I curated with a clinical dictionary. This cut review time by ~10 hours per 2,000 entries and improved billing accuracy by systematically correcting mis-coded interventions. It became the company’s first AI solution for non-numeric data.
